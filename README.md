## reclarify | automated categorisation and processing of LDIR particle data

Last updated: 04-MAY-2022

### Purpose
The purpose of this code is to automate the grouping of polymer analysis data from the Agilent Clarity software into polymer classes and then bin the resultant data by defined size groups to produce an overview of size and type. This is achieved through the creation of several routines as well as the provision of sample code in this package.

### Author
This code is written by [Joey O'Dell](https://github.com/joey4247) primarily in R. The base methodology is derived from the LDIR Polymer Analysis spreadsheet produced by [Ole Klein](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/coastal_environmental_chemistry/inorganic_environmental_chemistry/team/098593/index.php.de) at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon.

Further support has been provided by the [Department of Earth Sciences at Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences), [Department of Inorganic Environmental Chemistry at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon GmbH](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/coastal_environmental_chemistry/inorganic_environmental_chemistry/index.php.en), the [Helhomtz Coastal Data Centre](https://www.hereon.de/central_units/hcdc/index.php.en), and the [International Marine Litter Unit of the University of Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/marine-litter).

## Help
README files are provided throughout the code bundle. Further help is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/reclarify/wiki) and bug reports, suggestions, or faults can be reported [through the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/reclarify/issues).
